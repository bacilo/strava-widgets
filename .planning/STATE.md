## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases derived from natural requirement groupings (DATA → basic STAT/WIDG → advanced STAT/WIDG → automation)
- Coverage: All 25 v1 requirements mapped to phases with 100% coverage
- 01-01: Use native fetch instead of HTTP libraries (Node.js 18+ built-in)
- 01-01: Manual OAuth implementation instead of simple-oauth2 (simpler for two-call flow)
- 01-01: Manual atomic write pattern instead of write-file-atomic package (5 lines, same guarantee)
